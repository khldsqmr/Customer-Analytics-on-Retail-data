# Customer-Analytics-on-Retail-data

In this project, I have used the retail transactional dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Based on the UCI website, the data contains the transactions of a UK-based and registered non-store online retail carried out between 01-12-2010 and 09-12-2011. The company is the main seller of unique all-occasion gifts and the customers of the company are mainly wholesalers. My aim in this project is to perform exploratory, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis to help organizations to improve their sale and revenue using transactional data. I have extended my research of the analysis conducted on this dataset, and performed exploratory data analysis, determined product performance based on the transactions using association rules, devised a Loyalty program based on customer segmentation using clustering algorithms, and strategy recommendations for customer retention using five comparative classification models. I have carried out our analysis and implemented the following algorithms using Python programming:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Association Rules (Apriori)
3. Clustering Analysis
  * K-means clustering
  * Principal component analysis
4. Classfication Algorithms
  * Decision Trees
  * Naive Bayes
  * KNN
  * Random Forest

The preliminary results of our analysis are adequate for retail businesses to dive deep into the nuances of transactional models in retail and e-commerce industry.
